# Learning Objectives

This example is intended as a starting point for anyone planning develop
Android applications using Scala. Its learning objectives are:

- Android application development using Scala
    - using the Simple Build Tool (sbt) for Scala in conjunction with 
      [pfn's well-maintained plugin](https://github.com/pfn/android-sdk-plugin)
    - using IntelliJ IDEA
- Basic Android features 
    - [event-driven program execution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming)
    - handling input events
    - distinguishing between regular and long click/touch events
    - showing a notification message (toast)
    - playing a notification sound
    - Use of Scala primarily as a "better Java" (including mutable state)
